# Energy Trading Platform

This porject was made for an International Company during my end of studies Internship.
It's a Decntralized peer2peer web Application for trading Electricity between Electricity producers and consumers.

# Technologies used

- The MEAN Stack for the web application (MongoDB, ExpressJS, Angular, and NodeJS)
- Solidity for the Smart Contracts that generate Electricity Token and ensures transractions between nodes
- The application fetches data from the SolCast API that provides the app with useful indata such
as weather forecast and production statistics.
- Ganache is used to initialize the Blockchain Network

# What's next

Further development could be done but the work had stopped by the end of the internship.
The code still lacks a lot of optimization.
More modules can be added to ameliorate the application:
- Dynamic Real Time Generation of Electricity Tokens
- Auto Matching between Consumers and Producers
